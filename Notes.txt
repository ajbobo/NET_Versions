This is designed to report which .NET framework an app is using.
NOTE: All of the projects use the exact same C# file (Program.cs). Changing it for one changes it for all.

VSCode doesn't have easy support for .NET Framework 4.8, so I created the NET_4.8 project in VStudio and set up tasks for it here.
There is a VStudio solution so that these can be opened there, too

Building the solution in VStudio 2019 is weird.
    You may have to delete the bin/obj directories before NET_4.8 will build
    You may have to run a NuGet Restore before NET_5 will build
    NET_6 won't work in VStudio 2019 (.NET 6 is only supported in 2022) - I disabled the Solution build configuration for that project, but you can still right-click on it and try to build it

Some notes about versions:
.NET Framework 4.8 (or 4.8.1) - Windows only - Last of the "Framework" versions
.NET 5.0 - Cross-platform - New name for .NET Core
.NET 6.0 - Cross-platform - New name for .NET Core

The "dotnet" commandline app is for .NET Core/.NET - It is not part of .NET Framework.
